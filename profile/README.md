# Rapid Reservation

The goal of this project is to develop a web app quickly, efficiently and to meet the goals of the end user. The web app will allow customers to log in, see a model of the table and all available seating, and make a reservation. They then will be allowed to look at the menu and place an initial order, so that when they arrive, the food will be ready to be brought out, reducing wait times to essentially zero!
